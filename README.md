## About The Project



https://github.com/arthurbrenno/markovener/assets/64020210/50930660-b934-4c7e-a783-d57f2483a5ed

There are many ways of generating readable text. This engine focus on a method called _Markov Chains_ and _English words mapping_.

Here's why:

* **Stateless:** Markov Chains only depends on the previous state.
* **Easy of use:** Anyone can use and understand the _Markovener_ in an easy way.
* **Ngram power**: A common way of generating text is by dividing it into _ngrams_.

There is also a common workflow that the engine.Chain could be used. And you can check it out in [documentation](https://arthurbrenno.github.io/javadoc-markovener)

There are also test Classes Using JUnit for Unit Testing.

## Built With

The project was built with raw Java SE 11 and an external dependeny for PDF File reading

* [Java 11](https://www.java.com/)
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Apache PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/index.html)
